Language Switcher (module for Omeka S)
======================================

[Language Switcher] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows visitors to switch
between sites pages, when the sites are managed by language.

This module provides the same features than the [Omeka Classic] plugins [MultiLanguage]
and [Locale Switcher].

Important: the module has been renamed [Internationalisation].


Installation
------------

Warning: install module [Internationalisation]. Since the old module uses the
same code, there is no other change to do: simply remove this last before 
installing the new module.


TODO
----

- Return original page when it is not translated in a site, instead of an error.
- Add options to manage multilanguage property values (various ways).
- Add links for easier browsing between translated pages.
- Add a button to duplicate a site (item pool, pages and navigation, relations).
- Add a button to apply settings of another site (except language).


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [module issues] page on GitHub.
